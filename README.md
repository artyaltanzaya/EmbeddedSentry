# Real Time Embedded Systems

## Embedded Sentry

Objective:
- Use the data collected from a single accelerometer and/or gyro to record a hand
movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” a resource.
- Recorded sequence must be saved on the microcontroller, using a “Record Key”
feature.
- User then must replicate the key sequence within sufficient tolerances to unlock
the resource.
- A successful unlock must be indicated by a visual indication, such as an LED or
similar indicator.

Restrictions:
- The accelerometer/gyro must be held in a closed fist of either hand while
performing the mechanical sequence.
- An “enter key” and ”record” functionality must be developed to so the user knows
when to start the sequence of unlocking and recording respectively.
